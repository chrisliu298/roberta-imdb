# CSE142-Project-1-Sentiment-Analysis

We used [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) to do the sentiment analysis task.


## Credit
 I referred to [Chris McCormick's guide of fine-tuning BERT](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/) and it helped me with constructing the training loop.
