# CSE142 Project 1 Sentiment Analysis

We used [RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) to do the sentiment analysis task.

## Getting Started

`train.py` preprocesses the data, trains the model, and generates the prediction. The `model/` and `data/` directories are empty because it is where the dataset and the saved model should be in. 


## Credit

I referred to [Chris McCormick's guide of fine-tuning BERT](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/) and it helped me with constructing the training loop.
